# 🐍 Python Practice & Learning Journey

This repository is my personal lab and digital notebook for learning and practicing Python. Here I solve problems, experiment with code, and create small projects to hone my programming skills.

## 📁 Repository Structure (under development)

Projects and scripts are organized by topic or complexity level:
*   `/basics/` — fundamental concepts (calculators, converters, simple algorithms).
*   `/projects/` — more complex mini-projects.
*   `/algorithms/` — implementation of classic algorithms and data structures.
*   `/games/` — console or simple graphical games.
*   `/scripts/` — useful scripts for automation.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mao-Yenrai/Python-Projects.git`
2.  Navigate to the directory of the project you're interested in.
3.  Run the `.py` file: `python filename.py`

## 🤝 Goals

*   Systematize the learning process.
*   Visually track my progress.
*   Build a portfolio for future employers or colleagues.
*   Receive feedback from the community.
